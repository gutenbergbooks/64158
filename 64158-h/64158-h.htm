MEMORIAL SERMON.</span></h2>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare
thy mighty acts.”—Ps. 145: 4.</p>

</div>

<p>The past is full of interest and instruction, so that all
concede the value of history. Its importance is manifest
from the fact that about two-thirds of God’s Holy Word
is historical.</p>

<p>The history of any and every part of the earth is interesting;
but our own Country and State, the town in which
we reside, the Church to which we belong, and the family
whose name we bear, are to us of the greatest interest.
To-day, therefore, we turn our attention to the history of
this Church, Society and town.</p>

<p>The sources of information on these subjects, though
bulky, are meagre and imperfect. We have</p>

<p>1. Minutes of the Proprietor’s Meetings from 1706 to
1801.</p>

<p>2. Records of Town Meetings from 1713.</p>

<p>3. Minutes of the meetings of the First Ecclesiastical
Society, from December, 1753.</p>

<p>4. Ecclesiastical Society’s Treasurer’s books from 1802.</p>

<p>5. Church Records from December 27th, 1727. These
are not complete; the book kept by Mr. Rood is missing.</p>

<p>6. MSS. Notes of Rev. W. H. Moore.</p>

<p>7. Records of Baptist and Methodist Churches.</p>

<p>8. Memoir of Mrs. Mary A. Boardman, by Rev. Dr.
Schroeder.</p>

<p>9. And the memory of persons still living.</p>

<p>In 1703, Col. Robert Treat and others representing 111
persons, all of Milford, obtained a patent to a certain tract
of land in New Haven County, formerly called Weantinogue.
This tract contained 84 square miles, embracing
what is now known as the towns of New Milford, and
Bridgewater, with parts of Brookfield and New Preston.
It cost the Proprietors about 8 mills an acre. The first
settler, though not a Proprietor, was John Noble, who
came here from Massachusetts, in 1707. The Indians
were then and long afterwards numerous, but seem always
to have been on friendly terms with the settlers.
The Proprietors held their meetings at Milford until 1715.
The first Town Meeting seems to have been held in 1713.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
The town was first represented in the Legislature in 1725.
The first record of freemen was made in 1744. The town
belonged to New Haven Colony until the incorporation of
Litchfield County, in 1751. The first bridge over the
Housatonic, between the sea and its source, was built here
in 1737. The first school in the town was opened in 1721,
and was taught 4 months in the year, the town paying
half the expense.</p>

<p>In 1707 two persons came into New Milford.</p>

<p>In 1712 there were here 12 families or between 60 and
70 persons. A census, taken in 1756, reports 1137 in the
town; another taken in 1774, reported 2776, while in
1800, after parts of the town had been ceded to Brookfield
and Washington, the population was 3198. The census of
1870, gives the population of the present New Milford,
as 3586, while Bridgewater, formerly a part of this town,
has 877 inhabitants.</p>

<p>New Milford has always been loyal to the cause of freedom.
In 1779 the town voted 4 bushels of wheat a month
to every man who volunteered for six months, and three
bushels a month to the militia men who marched when
ordered; but, if they failed to report within eight days
after marching orders, they forfeited this premium. The
town also supported the families of men while absent in
the Continental army. In 1778 the Articles of Confederacy
proposed by Congress, styled “The United States of
North America,” were adopted in town meeting, except
part of the 5th article, which respects the mode of choosing
Delegates to Congress. It was “Voted that the Freemen
will always hold the prerogative and sole power of
choosing our Delegates in Congress by vote.” Subsequently,
“said Articles of Confederacy were adopted in full by
the meeting without a dissenting voice.” In 1783 it was
voted, and a Committee was appointed to enforce the resolution,
that all refugees, or “skedaddlers,” as they would
now be termed, as well as all who had voluntarily gone
over to the enemy during the war, should be prohibited
from returning and settling in the town. The Adjutant-General
of Connecticut, reports the names of 222 men
from the town of New Milford as having served in the
armies of the United States during the Civil War of 1861-65.
This does not include the 37 who deserted nor the
<i>one</i> who was <i>dishonorably</i> discharged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span></p>

<p>The town, as such, has always upheld the cause of morality
and good order. In 1787 certain persons were
fined “for bringing into the town and entertaining unwholesome
inhabitants.” So early as 1729 it was voted in
town meeting that “James Hine have oversight of the female
sex during exercises” in Church. And so late as
1821 a certain person was fined $1.67 for “breach of the
Sabbath,” but this fine was remitted.</p>

<p>The way in which they cared for the poor and guarded
the interests of the town, appears from the vote of 1771—“That
a black bonnet, a red woman’s cloak, and a worsted
gown be kept for the daughter of Hannah Beeman; if
she die under age, the town to have them.”</p>

<p>The first sermon was preached here by Col. John Reid,
who had studied for the ministry in his youth. Mr. Daniel
Boardman, a preacher of the Gospel, came here in 1712.
The next year it was voted that the inhabitants should
pay all the expense that had been incurred in obtaining a
minister, also to lay out a pastor’s lot, to dig and stone up
a well for Mr. Daniel Boardman, if he became a settled
minister in New Milford. Meanwhile, the town allowed
5s. 6d. a week for the minister’s board. In 1715 the town
agreed to petition the General Court to “attain liberty for
the settlement of the worship and ordinances of God
among us.” This was the subject that then came up at
every meeting of the inhabitants. It was not until 1716
that they made arrangements for laying out a burying
ground of two acres; but for four years before that they
had been contriving and planning for the religious instruction
of themselves and families. The poverty of the
people appears in the resolution adopted as to Mr. Boardman’s
salary, one third of which was to be paid in grain,
two-thirds in labor, linen, or pork; the established price
of wheat was then 4s. a bushel, rye, 2s. 8d., corn 2s. and
oats 1s.; part of the agreement being that Mr. Boardman
should sell the grain which he had to spare at the same
prices to the inhabitants. In accordance with a vote of
the town, Mr. Boardman was ordained November 21st,
1716.</p>

<p>So far as the records show, there was then entire unanimity
of religious belief and opinion among the people. The
Ecclesiastical Society and the Town were practically one
and the same. Everything regarding the building and finances<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
of the Society was determined in Town Meeting.
The first division occurred in 1731-2, when 20 persons
withdrew to form a Quaker Society. They built a house
in 1742 and have continued their worship from that time
until the present, though at this date there is but one family
of them residing in the town.</p>

<p>In 1743 the inhabitants of “Newbury” were set off for
a separate religious Society, and in the division of the
Parsonage lands in 1755, £98 3s. 6½d., was given to this Society,
£13 14s. 6½d. to Newbury, and £5 12s. 7½d. to New
Preston. Newbury was the ancient name of Brookfield,
and was formed into a town in 1788, from parts of New
Milford, Danbury, and Newtown. The Church at Brookfield
was therefore organized, not in 1757, as heretofore
reported, but in 1743-4. The inhabitants of the “Neck,”
as Bridgewater, was originally called, early made representations
to this Society of the inconvenience of attending
worship here during Winter months. Part of their
tax was remitted on condition that they provided preaching
for themselves during the Winter; and for a number
of years Mr. Taylor and Mr. Griswold spent one Sabbath
in each of the three Winter months at the Neck. The
Church at Bridgewater was organized in 1809. Bridgewater
was set off as a town in 1856.</p>

<p>There must have been Episcopalians in town earlier, but
the first allusion to them occurs in the record of a town
Meeting in 1744, just previous to the death of Mr. Boardman:
“Voted, That those of us who are of the Church of
England shall be free from paying any charge for a minister
for one year, if circumstances remain as they now
are; but, if in the providence of God our Reverend Pastor
should be taken away, then the said Church men to
be under the same regulation as the rest.” The Rev. James
Beach, of Newtown, visited New Milford occasionally between
1740 and 1745, and a lay reader read service for some
time. The first Episcopal clergyman who resided here
was Rev. Solomon Palmer, who came in 1754. This Society
continued feeble for many years; but under the 20
years pastorate of the Rev. Charles G. Acly, just closed,
it has grown strong and healthy. It has now 132 families
and 265 communicants.</p>

<p>The Separatists, or Strict Congregationalists as they were
called, built a meeting house, in what is now the old cemetery,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
in 1761. They disbanded in 1812, uniting some
with this Society and some with the Episcopalians.</p>

<p>Between 1780 and 1785 the followers of Jemima Wilkenson,
who is described as a remarkably comely woman,
with dark hair and sparkling black eyes, built a house in
what is now the old cemetery, on the hill on the road towards
New Preston. They soon sold this building to the
Episcopalians and moved to Genesee, New York, where
Jemima resided.</p>

<p>The Baptists formed a small Church and erected a house
of worship in the lower end of the town called the Neck
(Bridgewater) in 1788-90, “but never had a pastor, and soon
moved elsewhere.”</p>

<p>The Baptist Church at Northville was organized February
9th, 1814, with 7 males and 16 female members, most
of whom had previously been connected with a Baptist
Church in Roxbury. Its present membership is 46. The
Baptist Church at Gaylordsville was formed about 1830
and has always been small. Its present membership is 33.
Somewhere about 1830 a Union Church was built at Merryall,
which was used chiefly, but not wholly, by the Baptists.
No Society was ever formed, and no service has
been held in the house for 20 years.</p>

<p>The Rev. Elijah Hebard, from Stratford circuit, seems
to have been the first Methodist Episcopal minister who
visited New Milford. In 1815 he preached at John Warner’s
in Pleasant Valley. Others followed, and in 1825 a
Society was formed in Gaylordsville; that Society still exists
and has now 66 members. In 1826 the Methodists
erected a Church at Northville; and in 1828-9 they erected
another on the Plains at a cost of $3,000. It is to be
regretted that these organizations at Northville and on the
Plains are both extinct and have been so for twenty-five
years. The Methodist Church in the Village was erected
in 1849 and dedicated by Bishop Janes in May, 1850—the
Rev. Wm. M’Allister, then being the Preacher in charge.
Its present membership is 130.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholics opened a place for worship in
1860-61, but had no resident priest until 1872. They
have now a large congregation, composed almost exclusively
of persons of foreign birth.</p>

<p>These are all the Religious Societies that have existed
in the town. Out of a population of 3,586 there is to-day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
a Church membership, exclusive of the Roman Catholics
of 807.</p>

<p>In 1871-2, this Church thoroughly canvassed the town,
exclusive of New Preston Society, distributing Bibles and
Tracts, and carefully reporting the Church attendance and
preferences of the people by families. Of the 707 <i>families</i>
reported, there were Congregational, 218; Episcopal, 156;
Methodists, 88; Roman Catholics, 46; 2d Advent, (colored)
18; Baptists, 15; Jews, 3; Lutherans, 2; Friends, 2;
Reformed Dutch, 1; and not attending any Church, 158.</p>

<p>With this general review of the Ecclesiastical history of
the town, we turn now to consider more minutely the
history of this, the oldest and always largest Church and
Society—the oldest but one and the largest in the County.</p>

<p>There was no Ecclesiastical Society until after 1750.
Until then, the town was the Society. It was the town
that provided for the supply of the pulpit, for the installation
of ministers, the erection and care of buildings, and
all expenses connected with public worship. The Church
held meetings for the election of Deacons, the discipline
of members, and the spiritual interests of the people. But
the town managed everything that now belongs to the Society.
It was the town that invited Mr. Daniel Boardman
to labor here, and that settled him as a pastor, making all
the arrangements for his installation. The town did the
same in the case of Mr. Taylor. So far as the records
show, the Church took no separate action in calling its
pastors until the invitation to Mr. Griswold, in 1790, when
it formally voted, as has been the custom ever since, to
concur in the Society’s action. From 1713 to 1750 a large
part of the business in Town Meeting was in regard to
Ecclesiastical affairs.</p>

<p>The first Meeting House, “40 feet long, 30 feet wide,
and 24 feet between “gists,” with suitable proportions,”
was built in 1718-19, but not opened for worship until
1720, and then it was in a very unfinished condition. In
1720 it was voted to wall up the gists before Winter and
fill in between the lathe and studs with timber and mortar.
The floor was not laid until 1723. This building
stood on the highway on Town Hill, a few rods North of
the present residence of Mrs. J. P. Treadwell. The second
house of worship, “64 feet long, 44 feet wide, and 27 fee
posts,” nearly twice the size of the first, was erected in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
1754, the town applying to the General Assembly for power
to sell the old Meeting House, and to tax non-resident
land holders for building the new one. This building
stood on the Village Green, nearly opposite the present residence
of Mr. Solomon E. Bostwick. The present edifice
was erected in 1833, and though much larger than the former,
for several years persons wishing slips have been
unable to obtain them. It would be a good Centennial
work to enlarge the building.</p>

<p>The Sabbath Day House was an institution that is unknown
to the present generation. In 1745 the town voted
“that any farmers, inhabitants, have leave to build a
small house to repair to on Sabbath day on the common
land, provided the public is not damnified thereby.” This
building was located “North of the Meeting House on the
side of the hill.” After the erection of the Church on the
Green, the Sabbath Day House was built on the spot where
now stands the house so long occupied by the Rev. Mr.
Acly. It is described to me by a lady still with us (Mrs. Eli
Mygatt) who went through it more than 70 years ago, as
a long, low building, with four large rooms, regarding
which frightful stories were told of the ghosts that inhabited
it. In this building, farmers, whose homes were distant,
stored loads of wood, and barrels of cider, and here
they warmed their bean soup, replenished their foot-stoves
and regaled themselves in the hour between services. Until
1870 the services were held morning and afternoon;
since 1870, the second service has been held in the evening.</p>

<p>The Chapel was built by individuals, with permission
of the Society in 1838-9. The Meeting Houses were not
heated until 1823-5, when two box stoves were put into
the second Meeting House. In November, 1833, the Society
voted to obtain “2 of Dr. Nott’s stoves and one ton
of anthracite coal for the Winter.” Furnaces were put in
in 1860, when the Church was improved at a cost of $5,225,
and land for sheds was bought. The organ was obtained
in 1860, at a cost of $1,200.</p>

<p>The Parsonage was bought in August, 1870, at a cost of
$6,000, paid for by subscription, and presented, with certain
conditions attached, to the Society. Originally, the
people were called to worship, as to all public meetings,
by the beat of a drum, for which an appropriation was
made in 1716. For many years after the first Church<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
building was occupied, the town annually appointed a
person to beat the drum and voted him pay for his services.
I have been unable to discover when the first bell
was obtained. A Church clock which hung in the steeple
of the second Meeting House must have been bought about
a century ago. In 1780 the liabilities of the Society are
thus stated: “Arrears yet due on account of clock £7 3s.
5d. and due Widow Prudence Collins, for sweeping the
Meeting House £1 10s. 0d.”</p>

<p>Until 1745 this was the only Society and every person
in town was taxed for its support. From 1750 to 1790
persons who aided in supporting other Societies were by
vote, relieved from the tax for the support of this Society.
There is no instance on record in which a request for relief
on this plea was refused. From 1800, though this Society
had the legal right up to 1819, to tax all, only the
members of the Society were, in fact, taxed for its benefit.
The proposal to meet necessary expenses by the sale of
slips was first made in 1851 and rejected by a large majority.
This plan was adopted in 1854 and has continued until
the present. Previous to that, committees had from
time to time “seated and dignified the Meeting House.”
The resolutions of 1756, were, that “all persons of the
age of 56 years and upwards should be seated in the first
rank of seats, and all other persons according to the rates
and taxes they have paid towards building said Meeting
House.” But for special reasons of honor or infirmity,
persons were often, by vote, placed in the highest rank.
In subsequent seatings, it was usually voted that “no person
should be placed lower than he had previously been.”</p>

<p>This Society does not seem ever to have received pecuniary
aid from sister Churches, or from individuals outside
of its own membership. In 1719 an agent was sent
to Milford “to see what they would do for the support of
the Gospel here.” That application was probably to the
Proprietors, and there is no record of its result. The Proprietors
set apart what were called “Donation” or “Parsonage
Lands for the support of the Gospel according to
the Presbyterian Congregational order, in the town.”
From these lands a 24s. lot was given to Mr. Boardman
as part of his settlement, and probably a similar lot to Mr.
Taylor at his ordination. The remainder of this land was
sold at different times before 1790, and the proceeds given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
to the various Societies within the town in proportion to
the “List” of their members. And in 1790 the Proprietors
appointed a Committee to examine the roads belonging to
them, to narrow them and sell the land thus obtained.
This Committee completed its work in 1810. Part of the
proceeds of the land thus sold from the highways, was donated
to this Society, and carefully invested in Hartford
Bank Stock, which it holds to this day.</p>

<p>In 1792 Col. Josiah Starr, who had long been Treasurer,
purchased some Hartford Bank Stock, for the Society, and
to complete the payment advanced out of his own funds
$192 24. Mr. Comstock, a later Treasurer, has recorded
that this was never repaid. Col. Starr, doubtless, intended
this as a gift to the Society.</p>

<p>September 13th, 1860, a vote of thanks was passed to
John P. Treadwell, Esq., then of New York, for the gift
of $500 toward the purchase of an organ.</p>

<p>September 19th, 1834, a vote of thinks to Miss Gratia
M. Merwin for the donation of $100.</p>

<p>March 3d, 1870, a vote of thanks to Royal I. Canfield, for
$500, given for a permanent fund, the avails to be used for
the support of the Gospel. Mr. Canfield had previously
(1861) given additional land for sheds, which cost him $100.</p>

<p>Mr. Homer Beard, who died February, 1871, bequeathed
to the Society land which was sold for $1,030.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Phebe Beard, his widow, who died September,
1874, left to the Society property which netted $832.</p>

<p>This Society has always shown a characteristic New England
thrift and prudence in regard to its finances. So
early as 1755, it appointed a committee to “take care of
the money, coming from the sale of the Parsonage lands,
to loan out said money on good and sufficient security.”
From that time to this, the Society has always had money
loaned, invested in Government securities or in Bank
stock. And in 1787, it was voted that only the interest
over <i>six</i> per cent., should be used for current expenses.
But this rule has not been observed or the Society would
now be rich.</p>

<p>From 1752 until 1796, all the educational and religious
affairs of the town were under the control of this Society.
It located the Schools, fixed the tax, collected it, and superintended
the Schools through committees annually appointed.
It was, in fact, the School Society for the Town,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
and as such received Benoni Stebbins’ legacy. It fixed
and collected the tax for the salary of the ministers, “for
the sweeping out of the Meeting House.” It also, in some
measure, managed the financial affairs of the Episcopal
Society; for in 1771, after appointing Ichabod Bostwick
to gather the minister’s rate, it appointed “Solomon Hodkiss
to gather a rate for Mr. Clark.” And in 1772 this Society
issued a notice “to warn all the Church people to
meet together on Monday, the 13th day of instant, April,
at St. John’s Church at 8 of the clock in the morning,
then and there to consult such measures as they shall
think proper to procure a Glebe house for the Rev. Mr.
Clark, and to do such other business as shall be thought
proper.” The minutes of the meeting thus warned are recorded
as “a meeting of the inhabitants of the 1st Ecclesiastical
Society—holden by the Church of England.”
This was doubtless done, in a fraternal spirit, to give legal
efficacy to the action of the Episcopal Society in disposing
of one Glebe and purchasing another. This shows
the kindly feeling that then, as now and always, has governed
the members of this Society. The Church Review
(vol. ii, p. 317,—See Hollister’s Hist. of Conn. vol. ii, p.
545—Note) states that “certain Churchmen in New Milford
were fined for refusing to attend the meetings of the
established Church. These fines were, by recommendation
of Mr. Beach, paid, and copies of the proceedings
taken to be forwarded to the King and council. The fact
becoming known, the authorities refunded the money and
granted permission to build a church, which before had
been refused.” I do not know the authority of the Church
Review for this statement; but I do know that there is no
warrant for it in Town or Society’s books. There is no
record of any refusal to permit Churchmen to build, nor
of the remittance of a fine upon any person for being absent
from the worship of this Church; yet the books contain
records of scores of votes remitting fines for breach
of the Sabbath and other minor offences. From 1752 to
1819 this Society had all the legal rights in its own hand.
But, in all the records there is no instance of anything
like intolerance, or a disposition to throw obstacles in
the way of others; while there are numerous instances of
its generosity, and readiness to aid those who entertained
a faith different from its own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>This Society has uniformly treated its ministers honorably
and kindly. It has always acted with a good degree
of unanimity. In every instance, except the first, the Society
has found it difficult to unite in the calling of a pastor.
At such times feeling has often run high, and when a call
was voted, there has often been a few votes in the negative
But the call once given and the pastor settled, parties
have disappeared and all united in treating the man
with the respect due to his office. Of the 8 pastors who
have preceded the present, 3—Boardman, Taylor, and
Elliot—died in office. Mr. Griswold left voluntarily, without
any action on the part of the Church or Society. Mr.
Porter resigned because of his “physical inability to perform
the duties belonging to so large and scattered a parish.”
Mr. Murdoch resigned to accept the invitation of
the Third Church in New Haven. In regard to Mr. Rood,
the Church and Society both voted unanimously that a
change was needful for their well being; but even then,
it voted him a gift of $400 and borrowed the money to give
it to him. In the only other instance in which a change
was desired, it was solely because of the physical infirmity
of the pastor, who was as universally admired for his
talents, as he was revered for his character. On his resignation,
the Society voted him a donation of $500. The
Society has always cared for the comfort of its pastors
and been faithful to its promises to them. In the times of
Messrs. Boardman and Taylor it was very poor and did not
always pay promptly; but then it allowed interest on all
arrearages. It gave Mr. Boardman a settlement in land
and increased his salary from £50 and 40 cords of wood,
“good and suitable for the fire,” to £125. It gave Mr.
Taylor a settlement of £1,000, payable in installments
within three years, and increased his salary from time to
time at his request. But in 1779—“the time that tried
men’s souls”—Mr. Taylor, “trusting to the generosity of
the members of the Society,” relinquished his salary of
£150, lawful money, from May 1st, 1778, to May 1st, 1779.
And in 1782, Mr. Taylor, “taking into consideration the
great burden and heavy taxes now lying on the people by
reason of the present war, and he, being free and willing
to bear a proportionate part of the cost and burden with
others of the Society,” did “abate and discharge to said
Society, the sum of £30, lawful money” from what was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
then due to him. And the Society, in its vote of thanks,
“allowed that £30 was his full equal part, according to
his interest or estate.” On the ordination of Mr. Griswold
the Society voted Mr. Taylor “a gratuity of £80, in
addition to all arrears then due to him.” Mr. Griswold’s
settlement was £200, with a salary of £100, “payable in
gold or silver, or produce at such prices as he would accept,
with interest on all arrears.” £15 was afterwards
added to his salary “because he did not receive so much
wood as he expected.” And from 1794 to 1801 the Society
annually voted him, usually £30 “in view of the high
price of provisions the current year.” Mr. Elliot’s salary
was $550: but from 1819 to his death $50 additional was
annually voted to him except in 1826. Mr. Rood’s salary
was $600, while Messrs. Porter and Greenwood had $700;
Mr. Murdoch accepted the call of the Church and Society
at a salary of $800, which, on his application, was gradually
increased to $2,000. And in 1868 members of the
Society presented him $1,750.</p>

<p>This statement of facts shows that this Society has aimed
to do well by its pastors, and that these pastors were men
who were worthy of good treatment.</p>

<p>These pastors were:—</p>

<p>1. Daniel Boardman—Graduated at Yale College, 1709,
was ordained here November 21st, 1716, and died August,
25th, 1744.</p>

<p>2. Nathaniel Taylor was born in Danbury, August 27th,
1722; graduated at Yale College, in 1745; was ordained
pastor here June 29th, 1748, and died here December 9th,
1800. He fitted many boys for College and married the
daughter of his predecessor.</p>

<p>3. Stanley Griswold was born in Torringford, November
14th, 1763; graduated at Yale College, in 1786; was ordained
pastor here June 20th, 1790; became a Unitarian,
threw open the sacraments to all, and was censured by
Consociation. He left town in 1802, and edited a political
paper in New Hampshire. In 1805 he was appointed Secretary
of Michigan Territory. In 1809 he was sent to the
U. S. Senate, was afterwards Chief Judge of the N. W.
Territory, and died at Shawneetown, Ill., August 25th, 1815,
aged 52.</p>

<p>This Church and Society united in forming the Litchfield
South Consociation, on July 7th, 1752. But feeling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
aggrieved by the action of the Association and Consociation
in relation to Mr. Griswold, the Society, September
1805, by a unanimous vote withdrew from said Consociation,
for intermeddling in the private affairs of this Society
and excommunicating the pastor unheard in his own defence.
It stood unconsociated until the installation of Mr.
Elliot, when dropping the half-way covenant, which was
adopted here in 1769, it was received into the Fairfield
Consociation, February 24th, 1808. It returned to Litchfield
South Consociation, April 27th, 1836.</p>

<p>4. Andrew Elliot, son of Rev. Andrew Elliot, of Fairfield;
graduated at Yale College, in 1790; was ordained
pastor here February 24th, 1808, and labored most successfully
until his death, May 9th, 1829. No pastor of this
Church has exerted a more powerful and healthy influence
upon the town than Mr. Elliot. The most extensive and
genuine revival that ever blessed this community, was under
his ministry.</p>

<p>5. Heman Rood was born in Vermont; graduated at
Middlebury College in 1819, and Seminary in 1825; was
ordained pastor at Gilmanton, N. H., June 12th, 1826-30;
was pastor in New Milford from 1830 to 1835. Mr. Rood’s
pastorate was the briefest this Church has ever had. He
was afterwards professor in the Theological Seminary, at
Gilmanton, N. H., 7 years.</p>

<p>6. Noah Porter, son of Rev. Noah Porter, D. D., of
Farmington, was born December 14th, 1811; graduated at
Yale College, in 1831; at Yale Seminary, in 1836; was ordained
pastor here April 27th, 1836, and resigned December
31st, 1842; after serving the South Church, Springfield,
Mass., 4 years, he then became a professor in Yale University
of which institution he was elected President, and inaugurated
October 11th, 1871.</p>

<p>7. John Greenwood was born in Berwick, Yorkshire,
England, June 5th, 1794, and was ordained pastor at Royston,
Cambridgeshire, June 20th, 1822-July 17th, 1836; installed
pastor at Bethel, April 18th, 1838-February 1842;
after serving this Church as settled pastor for one year, he
was installed pastor April 24th, 1844, and resigned May 19th,
1849. In 1843 he received the honorable degree of A. M.
from Yale College.</p>

<p>8. David Murdoch, was born in Glasgow, Scotland; graduated
at Union College, in 1845; Union Theological Seminary,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
1848; ordained pastor here September 18th, 1850, and
remained until September 28th, 1869. He was installed pastor
of the New Haven Third Church, October 1st, 1869, and
remained until May 15th, 1874.</p>

<p>9. James B. Bonar graduated at Wabash College, 1853;
at Union Theological Seminary, New York, 1856; ordained
—— by the Third Presbyterian Church, New York,
March 18th, 1857; installed pastor American Presbyterian
Church, Montreal, Canada, June 6th, 1857, and left in 1869.
He was installed pastor at New Milford, June 30th, 1870.</p>

<p>The Church connected with this Society was organized
November 21st, 1716, with 8 male and 5 female members.
During the first pastorate 225 more were added by profession
and letter. During Mr. Taylor’s ministry of 42 years,
301 names were added to the roll. Mr. Griswold kept a
full record of Baptisms, Marriages, and Deaths during his
entire ministry. His list of admissions to the Church is
only to January 1st, 1797. From that date he seems to
have invited all persons to the Sacraments. Under his
ministry only 34 persons united with the Church. At his
ordination Mr. Elliott found only 43 members—showing
how the Church had been broken up in the 8 years preceding.
Nine years later, after the Church at Bridgewater
had been formed, Mr. Elliott reports a membership of
118; but this was before the revival that moved the town.
Three hundred and nineteen members were added to the
Church during Mr. Elliot’s ministry—most of them on
profession of faith. There were added to the Church under
Mr. Rood, 153, Mr. Porter, 116, and Mr. Greenwood, 46.
After the retirement of Mr. Greenwood, Rev. E. W. Andrews
was acting pastor for 6 or 8 months, and received
63 persons to Church fellowship. In the 19 years of Mr.
Murdoch’s ministry there were added to the Church, 243
persons; and under the present pastorate of 6 years 80 have
been received. The number of names on the Church roll
up to this date is 1593. In 1861 there was a reported membership
of 476; but the roll had not been revised and corrected
since 1836. A careful sifting of the list in the Fall
of 1870, showed a Church membership of 310 at the beginning
of the present pastorate. The actual membership to-day
is 332—27 of them over 75 years of age, and one of
them over 100 years. At the head of the list is Mrs. Polly
Canfield who united in 1812. Two persons are said to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
died in this town over 100 years of age—Harry Carpenter,
a colored man, and Noah Nodine, who was born in the
17th century and died in the 19th. Miss Sally Northrop,
who celebrated the anniversary of her 100th birthday on
the 29th of June is still living.</p>

<p>During the last century, the Church was sensitive as to
the character of its Deacons. Instead of electing brethren
at once to the office, it choose them to serve during the
Church’s pleasure. If acceptable after one or two years
trial, they were, by vote, “established as Deacons.” And
in 1750 the Church voted that one brother, who had thus
been on trial for two years, “should not be established in
the office of Deacon.” Twenty-one persons have so far
served the Church in this office, viz:—Samuel Brownson,
James Prime, John Bostwick, Job Terrill, Samuel Canfield,
Bushnell Bostwick, Roger Sherman, Benjamin Gaylord,
John Hitchcock, Sherman Boardman, Elizur Warner,
Joseph Merwin, Dobson W. M’Mahon, John Beecher,
Nicanor Stilson, Geo. W. Whittelsey, Geradus Roberts,
Seymour B. Green, William Hine, John J. Conklin, and
Ethiel S. Green. From 1716 to 1803, the Lord’s Supper
was administered 4 times a year; since 1808, every two
months.</p>

<p>Nineteen men from this Church have entered the Gospel
ministry, viz:—</p>

<p>1. David Bostwick, born here January 8th, 1721; was
ordained pastor at Jamaica, L. I., October 9th, 1745, where
he stayed until 1746. He was installed pastor of the First
Presbyterian Church, in New York City, in 1756, and died
in 1763. His work on Infant Baptism was published here
and in England, and republished in 1837.</p>

<p>2. Joseph Treat; graduated at Princeton College, in
1757. He was ordained pastor colleague of Rev. Dr.
Bostwick, First Presbyterian Church, N. Y. City, in 1762,
where he remained until 1784.</p>

<p>3. David Brownson; graduated at Yale College, in 1762,
and was ordained pastor at Oxford in 1764, staying until
1779. He died in 1806.</p>

<p>4. Benjamin Wildman; graduated at Yale College, in
1758; was ordained pastor at Southbury, in 1766 and died
in 1812.</p>

<p>5. Whitmon Welch; graduated at Yale College in 1762,
and died in 1776.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>6. Gideon Bostwick was born here in 1742; graduated
at Yale College in 1762. He was a teacher of the Classical
School established in Great Barrington, Mass., by Dr.
Whiting, Col. Dwight and other members of the Episcopal
Church, in 1766. Invited to act as Lay reader, he went
to England and received orders from the Bishop of London,
and was Rector at Great Barrington, from 1767 to
1793. He died here while on a visit to Mrs. Boardman,
who was Dr. Whiting’s daughter. [See Schroeder’s Memorial
of Mrs. M. A. Boardman.]</p>

<p>7. David Sandford was born in Milford, December 11th,
1737; graduated at Yale College in 1755; was ordained
pastor at Medway, Mass., April 14th, 1763, and continued
there until April 7th, 1810.</p>

<p>8. John Stevens; graduated at Yale College, in 1779;
was licensed by Litchfield South Association, 1780, and
died in 1799.</p>

<p>9. David Baldwin.</p>

<p>10. Daniel Marsh was born in 1762; graduated at Williams
College; was pastor of Bennington, Vt., from 1806
to 1820; died at Janesville, New York, in 1843.</p>

<p>11. Nathaniel W. Taylor, grandson of the second pastor of
this Church, was born here, June 13, 1786; graduated at
Yale College, in 1807; converted in College; was ordained
pastor at New Haven, on the first of April, 1812, and
retained the position until December 1822. He was then
Professor in Yale College Theological Seminary, and died
in 1858. He trained nearly 700 young men for the ministry.</p>

<p>12. Charles A. Boardman; was pastor at New Preston
from June 1818, until March 1830; was installed pastor at
New Haven, on the third of March, 1830, remaining until
September 1832. He was also installed pastor at Westport,
February 1833, and stayed until December 1836. He
died in 1860.</p>

<p>13. Orlo D. Hine was born here, October 28, 1815;
graduated at Yale College, in 1837; was ordained pastor
at Clinton, April 14th, 1841, laboring there until October
25th, 1842. He was also acting pastor at Fair Haven, Vt.,
from 1843 to 1845; acting pastor at Pontiac, Mich., from
1846 to 1851; installed pastor at North Woodstock, January
6th, 1852, and stayed until November 5th, 1855; and
was installed pastor at Lebanon the first of May 1856.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p>14. Merrit S. Platt was born in 1805; graduated at
Hamilton College; was ordained pastor at Madison, N.Y.,
September 1837, remaining until 1855; was acting pastor
at Hamilton, N. Y., 1855, staying until 1864; was also
acting pastor at Glassboro, New Field, Franklin, New
Jersey, in 1864. He is still living.</p>

<p>15. Eliezur Beecher, ordained by the Baptists about
1814; was never settled; preached mainly in this town.</p>

<p>16. Asahel Bronson was ordained about 1820 or 1825;
supposed to be dead.</p>

<p>17. John Treat Baldwin; graduated at Princeton College;
was ordained about 1820. He is still living.</p>

<p>18. George Todd; graduated at Yale College about
1820 or 1825; supposed to be living.</p>

<p>19. George Sterling was ordained pastor at Wayland,
Mich., December, 1874.</p>

<p>At least four men in this town have been active in National
affairs. The most distinguished was Roger Sherman,
a native of Mass., who came here in 1743. He was
clerk to this Ecclesiastical Society, from 1753 to 1761, and
established in the office of Deacon in 1757. Here he
wrought as a shoemaker, aided his brother in the store,
and in 1745 was appointed land surveyor for the County.
Removing to New Haven in 1761, he became judge of the
court of Common Pleas, a member of the upper House in
the Legislature, and judge of the Superior Court. In 1774
he was appointed a member of the first Congress, in which
he continued until his death, at which time he was in the
Senate, to which he was elected in 1791. He was a member
of the Governor’s Council of safety, and Mayor of
New Haven from 1784 to his death, July 23d, 1793. In
the Congress of 1776 he was a member of the Committee
appointed to draft the Declaration of Independence, as
well as of many of the other most important Committees,
and he was also a member of the board of war, and of the
board of treasury. His services to the Country were invaluable,
and few of his contemporaries left their impress
more clearly upon American institutions.</p>

<p>Elijah Boardman, third son of Deacon Sherman Boardman,
and grandson of the first pastor of this Church, was
born March 7, 1760. In 1821 he was elected to the U. S.
Senate; he died August 18th, 1823. Mr. Boardman’s earlier
years were in connection with this Society; but having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
married a daughter of the aforementioned Dr. Whiting,
a zealous Episcopalian who engaged in a pamphlet
controversy with Dr. Billamy, he afterwards identified
himself with the Episcopal Church and died in its communion.</p>

<p>Perry Smith, who died in 1852, was elected to the United
States Senate in 1836, and served one term. He
was connected with the Episcopal Society.</p>

<p>Orange Merwin, born here July 3, 1776, was in Congress
in 1826-7, during the administration of John Quincy
Adams. He died September 5th, 1854. He was a
member of this Society.</p>

<p>The Sabbath School was begun in 1812 or 14 by Rev.
Mr. Elliott, who for some time was the only teacher. The
first appropriation of money for its benefit by the Church
was in 1821. The present membership of the Sabbath
School is 300. The Infant Class in the Chapel was begun,
under its present teacher, Miss Isabella Wilson, in 1872.</p>

<p>Under Mr. Elliott’s ministry, prayer meetings became
common in the town. They were held on Sundays between
services, in the Town House and in the school
houses of the outlying districts. In times of religious interest
many week day meetings were held in various
places. A Saturday evening prayer meeting was held for
years in the parlors of Mr. and Mrs. Eli Mygatt, when
they lived on the spot now occupied by the residence of
Mrs. Sanford and afterwards in the Town house. But no
regular mid-week Church afternoon service was established
until during Mr. Rood’s pastorate, when the Friday afternoon
meeting was begun. The Tuesday evening meeting
was commenced in 1865 or 66. The Mother’s Monthly
Prayer Meeting began in 1869.</p>

<p>The gifts to the Church, so far, are these: July 14th,
1815, Deacon Dobson, and W. M’Mahon gave the Church
$100, the interest to be used for relief of poor members, or
for books. February 20th, 1820, Deacon M’Mahon gave
$400 to be used for the same purposes.</p>

<p>In 1844 Miss Lois Wells gave the Church $200 for the
relief of the poor, sick and destitute female members.</p>

<p>Mrs. Anna Hine, widow of Stephen, who died in 1851
or 2 bequeathed $200 to the Church.</p>

<p>And in January 6th, 1860, Miss Sully Northrop, who
completed her 100th year a few days ago, gave $200 to
be added to the Church Fund.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>The Benevolent Library originated in the gifts of Deacon
M’Mahon, Col. Samuel Canfield and Philo N. Heacock,
who took great interest in it. No additions have
been made to it for some years. It consists of about 600
volumes of standard works, and merits more attention
than it has lately received.</p>

<p>It is impossible to form any estimate of the amount of
money contributed by this Church and Society, to religious
and benevolent objects. Until after the installation
of Mr. Porter there was no system or regularity in its
charities. Collections were taken up as the town was visited
by agents, or as necessity seemed to require. It is
thought that contributions have been made regularly to
the A. B. C. F. M., and the Am. H. M. S., ever since
these societies were formed. The oldest record of any
contribution by this Congregation is the receipt of the
County Treasurer for £94 16s. 0d. which this Society
gave “for the suffering and distressed inhabitants of the
towns of New Haven, Fairfield and Norwalk.” This receipt
is dated September 1779, three months after the
towns named had been sacked by Major General Tryon.</p>

<p>From 1836 to 1871 the Congregation contributed regularly
to the Am. Ed., the Bible, the A. H. M., the Seamen’s
F. &amp; S. S. Union, the A. B. C. F. M., and the A.
Tract Societies. Since 1871 we have contributed annually
to the Bible S., Congregational Union, A. H. M. S.,
Fund for Disabled Ministers and their widows, the A. B.
C. F. M., and the A. M. Association.</p>

<p>The Rev. W. H. Moore states that, in the 17 years from
1859 to 1875, this Congregation contributed $18,876.53.
Dividing this into two periods, he finds that in the first
nine years you gave $3,765.90, and in the last eight years
$11,810.63, a gratifying increase, which, it is hoped we
shall fully maintain.</p>

<p>The Ladies’ Mite Society was formed in 1817 as a Dorcas
Society. For 50 years it has annually contributed
about $75, divided between A. H. M. S., Seamen’s F. and
A. Ed. Societies.</p>

<p>The Auxiliary to the Woman’s B. of Missions was formed
in May 1872, “The Golden Links,” and “Star Circle”

<p>Such, in brief, brethren, is the story of your Church,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
Society and town. It is one of which you need not be
ashamed. A careful study of these old records has increased
my respect and reverence for the men of the past.
Their courage in facing difficulties, their heroic endurance
of privation, their sturdy independence, their delight
in the ordinances of the Gospel, their readiness to assist
each other, and their generosity towards those who differed
from them in opinion, are worthy not only of warm
praise, but of careful imitation.</p>

<p>And yet these men of the past were not all saints and
patriots. In 1776 there were some bitter tories here: One
of these was compelled by a company of riflemen to walk
before them from New Milford to Litchfield carrying one
of his own geese the entire distance At Litchfield they
tarred him, made him pluck his own goose, bestowed the
feathers upon him, and drummed him out of the place,
after obliging him to kneel down and thank them for their
leniency. And in 1757 David Ferriss was paid 11s. out of the
Society’s treasury, to reimburse him for counterfeit money
which he had received as Collector. This nest of counterfeiters
was not broken up until 1768, when a dozen of
them were arrested. The old Church books show that
immorality was not unknown among Church members.
The pastoral letter which was issued to the Churches by the
Litchfield South Consociation in 1752, reveals a state of
things in these Churches worse than any known to-day.
Sixty years ago (1816) there was a distillery in every town—169
in Litchfield County,—26 of them in New Milford.
To-day there are three distilleries in town, and soon it is
hoped these will disappear and the nine places licensed to
sell liquors.</p>

<p>There is abundant cause for gratitude. There has been
progress in every direction. In our beautiful village—than
which there is not now a lovelier or a healthier in
New England—with our system of concrete walks, lamps
and water works, our substantial Town Hall and enlarged
school privileges—we may here spend life as pleasantly
and profitably, doing the will of God from the heart—as
was could anywhere on the face of the globe. With all
these blessings and privileges there is, of course, an increased
responsibility. It becomes us to conserve and
improve all that the fathers have left us, and hand down
an unimpaired inheritance to the generations that are to
follow.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&trade;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away&mdash;you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the
Foundation&rdquo; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&trade; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&trade;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&trade; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&trade; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&trade; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

or any Project Gutenberg&trade; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&trade; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&trade;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&trade;&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&trade; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&trade; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
